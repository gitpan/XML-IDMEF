DESCRIPTION

  XML::IDMEF - A perl module for easily creating/parsing IDMEF messages

  IDMEF module is a wrapper around XML::Simple, providing an interface
  designed to simplify the parsing and creation of IDMEF messages. IDMEF
  is an XML based standard for representing Intrusion Detection alert
  messages (http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/).

  The interface provided by XML::IDMEF is designed to make it very simple
  to build an IDMEF message while parsing a log file with a key-value 
  structure, which is the most common situation when writing a log export
  module for a given software.
