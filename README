DESCRIPTION

  XML::IDMEF - A perl module for easily creating/parsing IDMEF messages

  IDMEF module is a wrapper around XML::Simple, providing an interface
  designed to simplify the parsing and creation of IDMEF messages. IDMEF
  is an XML based standard for representing Intrusion Detection alert
  messages (http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/).

  The interface provided by XML::IDMEF is designed to make it very simple
  to build an IDMEF message while parsing a log file with a key-value 
  structure, which is the most common situation when writing a log export
  module for a given software.


  ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING ******* WARNING *******

   This release (>0.09) introduces major internal changes compared
   with the previous versions. Furthermore, it implements the most
   *final* version of IDMEF. 

   You'd hence better check that using this version of the module
   does not break anything in your code (it should not, but, well...
   you know...)

   And of course: this is a beta release and has not been thoroughly
   tested. Please try it out if you can and report success/failure to
   the author (erwan@cpan.org).

   Use in production systems is at your own risks.

PREREQUISITES

  Requires XML::DOM and a XML::Parser.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the IDMEF.pm file to your lib/XML directory. To find out which paths
  perl uses to locate modules, do 
  'perl -e "print join(\"\n\", @INC), \"\n\";"'


STATUS

  This version is a beta release, and has not yet been thoroughly
  tested in production environment. It has been succesfully run on both
  linux and openbsd. 
  If you encounter any problems installing or running this release, please
  email the author and provide him as much information as possible on the
  bug and its context.

  Please send any feedback to the author: erwan@cpan.org


NEW IN THIS RELEASE

  The API is now compliant with IDMEF 1.0, and out() respects the order
  of IDMEF tags, as specified in the IDMEF DTD.
  See 'Changes' for a detailed history.


BUGS
  
  XML::IDMEF uses internally a simplified version of the IDMEF DTD, which makes
  that this module will fail to create some very specific IDMEF messages. 
  In particular, recursive File tags are not accepted.
